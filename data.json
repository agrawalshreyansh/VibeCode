  {
    "input": "I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified of public speaking.",
    "output": "**That fear is very common and it proves you care about doing well.** Your nervousness is not a prophecy of failure. **Practice 4-4-4 breathing** for one minute. **Drill your first three lines** until they feel automatic—a strong start makes all the difference."
